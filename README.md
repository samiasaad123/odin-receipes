# odin-receipes
This is a repo for my first project on Odin Project. I will try my best to make it as polished as possible! :) I used HTML to make this basic website that shows 3 Pakistani dishes with their ingredients and cooking instructions. Once I am familiar with CSS, I will come back and style this website accordingly.
