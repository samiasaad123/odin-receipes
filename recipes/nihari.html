    <h2><em><strong>What is Nihari?</strong></em></h2>
    <p>Nihari is a popular and flavorful slow-cooked meat stew originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is made
        typically with lamb or beef. The dish is prepared by simmering meat, bone marrow and various aromatic spices for
        several hours. The slow-cooking process allows the meat to become tender and infuses the flavors of the spices
        into the dish. </p>
